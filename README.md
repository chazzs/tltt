# Too Loud To Talk (tltt)
A simple hyper-local chat web app.

For those times when you just can't hear the person you are talking to or, for the times when quiet is the name of the game. You can pass along a simple message and don't have hassle with SMS or other messaging services or noisy notifications or buzzing.

* Pass back and forth to read and/or respond.

#### features

### Hyper-local?
Simply put; a static HTML web appliation that can be hosted as static HTML or run from a local copy.  There is no need for a network as this does not send or receive message. Just a blank board for you to type on and clear easily.
